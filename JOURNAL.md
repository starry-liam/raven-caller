# July 12th: Started the schematic 

[I came up with the idea and started the schematic. I choose the xiao seeed samd21 because its small and has the specs I need. I also did the schematic for the NAND, IO expander, Neopixel, Rotary encoder, and started the usb lipo charger.]

[forgot to take pics of the schematic here sorry!]

**Total time spent: 5hrs**
# June 13th: Finished schematic!

[I got the whole schematic done. The main issue was the lipo charger but It has a bunch of protection IC's so I shouldn't ever have to take the case apart to charge it.]

# June 14th: traces v1 and v2 done!

[I got traces for the version 1 of the pcb done. I had it reviewed by fellow hackclubbers and they gave good tips to Improve it. I scraped v1 and restarted for v2. It's much cleaner now and I took advatage of having a double sided pcb.]
v1:
